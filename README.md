# Event Management System (EMS)

## Overview
The Event Management System (EMS) is a web application designed to facilitate the management of events, including user registration, event creation, ticket booking, and user authentication. The application utilizes Spring Boot for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and JWT for secure authentication.

## Features
- **User  Registration and Authentication**: Users can register and log in using JWT tokens.
- **Event Management**: Admin users can create, update, and delete events.
- **Ticket Booking**: Users can book tickets for events, view their tickets, and manage bookings.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different roles (USER, ADMIN) with specific permissions for accessing various endpoints.
- **Date and Time Validation**: Ensures that event timings do not overlap.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: For building the RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: For data storage.
- **Joda-Time**: For handling date and time.
- **MapStruct**: For object mapping between DTOs and entities.
- **Spring Security**: For securing the application and managing user authentication.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure user authentication.
